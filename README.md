Scaling your startup with the power of Open Source

## Step Three

Excellent! You have messages, you have a databae, you have an app.

Are you ready to launch? You think so, so you try it with some friends.

They give you some feedback. You snatch your device back and go to the gym to let out your frustration. What do they know?

Alot, it seems. They are your target userbase and current apps have given them some expectations.

Right now, your app can send and receive messages. It can also save them in your PostgreSQL database.

But it is all manual. The user has to close and then reopen the app to refresh (or they can swipe to refresh when you actually get a chance to implement it)

You need something to allow real-time communication. A colleague recommends Apache Kafka but you do not have time to learn about clusters and topics and brokers, you are hustling!

What other services allow for a Publish-Subscribe model to be implemented easily?
