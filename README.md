# slack_stack

Scaling your startup with the power of Open Source

## The Scenario

You have an idea to improve Slack, Teams and all those other tools. But you want to do it your way. On your terms.

You want to start with the basics and only add complexity to your architecture when it is absolutely vital.

You also want to use only Open Source Software, not just because you believe in it but also because it lets you run it on your laptop and the cloud

You start with what you know.

You are a mobile developer but you know the desktop is also where work is done. So you choose Flutter to make a productivity chat app that runs on all platforms

Let's begin

## How to use

This repository is broken up into sections. Each section/task is within a branch

In order to start, simply run:

`git checkout step-two`

and read the README. It will give you the context for the scenario and the tasks to complete.

Once you are done, run:

`git checkout step-three` and continue!

If you get stuck, you can also move directly to step-two and see the steps that were done to complete the tasks!
